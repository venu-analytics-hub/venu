# Python Capstone Project – Employee & Project Data Analysis

This project demonstrates real-world data analysis using Python, Pandas, and NumPy. It involves working with three related datasets: Employee, Project, and Seniority Level. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, merging, and conditional logic operations to extract meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Project Summary (STAR Format)

### ✅ **Situation**
A simulated business dataset involving three separate but related tables—**Employee**, **Project**, and **Seniority Level**—was provided to replicate real-world scenarios in workforce and project management.

### ✅ **Task**
To perform a comprehensive data analysis workflow involving:
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Dataset integration and aggregation  
- Applying business rules using Python logic

The goal was to extract meaningful insights and prepare the dataset for further business applications or visual analytics.

### ✅ **Action**
- Created DataFrames for each dataset and saved them as `.csv` files  
- Filled missing project costs using a **running average** with a `for` loop  
- Split full names into **First Name** and **Last Name** and removed the original column  
- Merged all three DataFrames into a unified `Final` DataFrame  
- Calculated a **5% bonus** for employees based on finished project costs  
- Demoted designation level for employees with failed projects and removed records with designation > 4  
- Added **“Mr.”/“Mrs.”** prefixes to names and dropped the gender column  
- Promoted designation level for employees aged above 29  
- Aggregated total project costs per employee into a separate `TotalProjCost` DataFrame  
- Filtered and displayed employees whose city names contain the letter **“o”**

### ✅ **Result**
Successfully created a comprehensive `.ipynb` notebook with:
- Clean and well-commented code  
- Real-world data cleaning and transformation  
- Strong understanding of joins, conditional logic, and aggregation

This project showcases practical data manipulation skills and prepares the dataset for business intelligence or dashboard development.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 🚀 Outcome
This capstone project highlights data wrangling, real-time logic building, and readiness for real-world data science scenarios. It was designed as a performance evaluation to assess practical knowledge in data analysis.
